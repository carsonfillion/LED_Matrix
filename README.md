# LED_Matrix
 
This is a project I created to give as a gift to my long distance
girlfriend for Valentines Day in 2019.

It a very simple control loop for an 8x32 LED matrix using the libraires created
by MajicDesigns. 

The hardware consists of 5 toggle switches (4 control, 1 power), the LED matrix itself,
and an Arduino Nano. It is all housed in a 3D printed case.
