# LED_Matrix
 
This was a project created for Valentines Day as something nice to give 
to my long disatnce girlfriend. Using an 8x32 LED Matrix and the helpful libraries
developed by MajicDesigns I was able to code a scrolling message system.

I implemented the hardware side using an Arduion Nano and 5 toggle swithces, 4 to control
the different messages and 1 for the display power. I aslo printed a neat 3D case from an open 
source site to house all the components.
